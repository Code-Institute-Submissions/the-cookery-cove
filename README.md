# The Cookery Cove

## UX

This web application is made for users who would like to store and easily access cooking recipes of different cuisines, categories, ingredients and difficulties. 
My target market could include anyone of any age group, but more specifically, this application is made for people who enjoy cooking, learning new recipes and wanting to share their own recipes with the online community.
This type of user will want to be able to have their own account where they can add, edit or delete any of their recipes, view recipes of different ingredients, categories and difficulties, and also explore different cuisines.
This user will also want to be able to know what allergens or main ingredients there are in these recipes, and how long these recipes will take to prepare and complete.
My project is a suitable way of achieving this because it provides a form for the user to use when signing in or registering onto the application, filters which will be used to sort recipes by categories, difficulties and cuisines, and functions which will allow the user to create and update their own recipes, as well as delete them.
